## How to Load Configuration in a Docker container running in AWS ##

Managing configuration from the command line is not enough. Applications need a way to pull environment specific configuration in order to run. 

This example uses S3 with KMS encryption for the configuration store, but will work with any supported storage solution.

1. Add [docker-entrypoint.sh](../examples/docker-entrypoint-env.sh) script to the repo. 
2. Replace `./app` in the script with the correct application executable. 
```bash
exec ./my-application
```
3. When using secrets injection, add `-i` to the pull command in the script to inject secrets from Secrets Manager.
```bash
cstore pull -le -t $CONFIG_ENV -v $CONFIG_VER -i
```

4. Use the `ENTRYPOINT` command in place of the `CMD` command in Dockerfile to run the shell script. 
```docker
ENTRYPOINT ["./docker-entrypoint.sh"]
```
5. Update the `Dockerfile` to install [cStore](https://github.com/turnerlabs/cstore/releases/download/v3.8.3-alpha/cstore_linux_amd64) for Linux (or the appropriate os) adding execute permissions.
```docker
RUN curl -L -o  /usr/local/bin/cstore https://github.com/turnerlabs/cstore/releases/download/v3.8.3-alpha/cstore_linux_386 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cstore
```
6. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file to specify which environment config should be pulled by the `docker-entrypoint.sh` script.    
```bash
    environment:
      CONFIG_ENV: dev
      CONFIG_VER: v1.0.0 # optional
      AWS_REGION: us-east-1
```
7. In the same folder as the `Dockerfile`, use cStore to push the `.env` or `.json` files to an AWS S3 bucket with a `dev` tag. Check the resulting `cstore.yml` file into the repo.
8. Set up the [S3 Bucket](S3.md) and KMS key with a policy to allow AWS container role access.

9. Set up the AWS container role policy to allow S3 bucket access.
```yml
data "aws_iam_policy_document" "app_policy" {
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    actions = [
      "s3:Get*",
    ]

    resources = [
      "${var.aws_s3_bucket_arn}/*",
    ]
  }

  # Required when injecting AWS Secrets Manager secrets.
  statement {
    effect = "Allow"

    actions = [
      "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",
    ]

    resources = [
      "arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:${var.account_id}:secret:${var.config_context}/*",
    ]
  }
}

variable account_id {}

variable config_context {}
```

10. Deploy the conainer.
